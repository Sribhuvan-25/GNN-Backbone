# Methane GNN Pipeline

This pipeline implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for predicting methane-related properties (ACE-km and H2-km) using microbial community data. The pipeline includes graph construction, sparsification, model training, and model explanation.

## Components

The pipeline consists of three main components:

1. **MethaneGNN_dataset.py**: Handles data loading, preprocessing, graph construction using Mantel test, and graph sparsification using KNN.

2. **MethaneGNN_models.py**: Implements various GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN) and the GNNExplainer for model interpretability.

3. **MethaneGNN_pipeline.py**: Orchestrates the complete workflow, including training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Uses the Mantel test to identify significant correlations between microbial families.
- **Graph Sparsification**: Applies k-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach to reduce graph complexity.
- **Multiple GNN Architectures**: Supports GCN, GAT, GATv2, and GIN models.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implements k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- **Model Explainability**: Uses GNNExplainer to identify important edges and nodes for predictions.
- **Visualization**: Provides detailed visualizations of model performance and explanations.

## Usage

```python
from MethaneGNN_pipeline import MethanePipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = MethanePipeline(
    data_path='../Data/New_data.csv',
    k_neighbors=10,
    mantel_threshold=0.05,
    model_type='gat',
    hidden_dim=128,
    num_layers=4,
    dropout_rate=0.3,
    batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    weight_decay=1e-4,
    num_epochs=300,
    patience=30,
    num_folds=5,
    save_dir='./methane_results'
)

# Run the complete pipeline
results = pipeline.run_pipeline()
```

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loads microbial abundance data
   - Filters low-abundance/prevalence families
   - Transforms data using double square root transformation

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - Uses Mantel test to identify significant correlations between families
   - Creates edges between significantly correlated families
   - Applies KNN sparsification to reduce graph complexity

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trains separate models for each target variable (ACE-km and H2-km)
   - Uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance
   - Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting

4. **Model Explainability**:
   - Uses GNNExplainer to identify important edges for predictions
   - Visualizes explanations as network graphs

5. **Results and Visualization**:
   - Creates scatter plots of predicted vs actual values
   - Calculates performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ²)
   - Visualizes model explanations
